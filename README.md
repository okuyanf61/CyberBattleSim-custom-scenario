# CyberBattleSim Custom Scenario

To use this custom scenario, copy all the files into the "CyberBattleSim" folder. Just start jupyter with `jupyter notebook`, or `venv/bin/jupyter notebook` if you are using a virtual environment setup. You can use the custom scenario from the "mfo-custom-scenario.ipynb" file in the "notebooks" folder.
